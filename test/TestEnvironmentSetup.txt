Steps to bring a test environment online.
Thomas Keeley, 2017

Prepare the Environment:
- Install the following:
-- Apache2
-- PHP7
-- Apache2 mod_php7
-- Git (yeah, I know, but if I don't say it....)

Set the code location (working directory)  EG: /home/tskeeley/Documents/Repositories/CIAB
- git clone

Configure Apache2 either as a virtual host or the only host running:
- Set the document root to the working directory
- Set the directory options for the working directory as permissive with indexes
-- <Directory "<working directory">
--   Options Indexes
--   AllowOverride all
--   <IfModule mod_access_compat.c>
--     Order allow,deny
--     Allow from all
--   </IfModule>
--   <IfModule !mod_access_compat.c>
--     Require all granted
--    </IfModule>
-- </Directory>
- Note: You can turn on ssl as well if you so choose, of course.

Configure CIAB in the Working Directory:
- copy .ht_meetingsignin_config.php-EXAMPLE to .ht_meetingsignin_config.php
- edit .ht_meetingsignin_config.php
-- update ADMINEMAIL to yourself
-- update ADMINPASS (if you want, not needed generally, unless doing barebones deployment, which the code isn't fully supporting yet, that I know of)
-- update ADMINACCOUNTS to include your NeonCRM AccountID (helps you see everything)
-- update DB entries if using a database, not implemented yet (soon though)
-- update NEONID and NEONKEY to the NeonCRM Test instance

Start apache, point your browser to localhost and enjoy testing!
